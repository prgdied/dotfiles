Linux Config:
I use this setup on both my home desktop and my work laptop. Everything here should work either on a laptop or pc with multi monitors. You may have to configure monitor settings for best results.

Primary programs / applications
1. Waybar
2. Rofi
3. Pywal
4. Waypaper
5. NVIM
6. Kitty
7. Niri <3
8. swaybg for niri overview backdrop
9. Dolphin is goated
10. xwayland-sattelite
11. Swaync
12. 

Should work well with either Sway or Hyprland. Waybar has been configured for both. Started using Niri and this has taken priority.

Trying to keep track of other important packages:
1. Grim
2. Autotiling for sway
3. hyprlock
4. cliphist
5. gpu-usage-waybar
6.
